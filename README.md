SchoolOS: The Cognitive Operating System

Current Version: v0.1 (Alpha)
Source of Time: handover.schema.prisma
Objective: Co-evolution of Human and Artificial Intelligence.

1. Core Philosophy

We are not building an ERP for a school. We are building a Biological Metasystem.
Traditional education software optimizes for administration. SchoolOS optimizes for yield.

Yield of Capital: Tracking every cent from tuition to tax (Lucro Real).

Yield of Space: Maximizing occupancy and ROI of physical assets.

Yield of Soul: Tracking the longitudinal development of human intelligence through symbiotic AI pairing.

2. The Architecture (The Body)

The Heart: Financial Ledger

Function: A sequential, immutable ledger that tracks Cash Flow, Tax Regimes (ISS/ICMS), and Commission Splits in real-time.

Why: To separate "Revenue" from "Profit" and "Sales" from "Quality."

The Brain: The Central Room (Symbiosis Engine)

Function: Manages the lifecycle of AI Shards. Every student receives a unique neural model upon enrollment.

Protocol: The system tracks Resonance (Human-AI Sync) and enforces Severance (Cold Storage) upon exit. This preserves the digital continuity of the student's mind.

The Nervous System: Flow & VARK Engines

Function: Replaces "Grades" with "Flow States." Replaces "Teaching" with "Cognitive Calibration."

Mechanism: * Flow Engine: Micro-grading (12,000 data points/year) to prove mastery without anxiety.

Cognitive DNA: Real-time VARK profiling to match teaching output to student input hardware.

The Immune System: Network & Risk

Function: Identifies "At-Risk" nodes (Students) and "High-Leverage" nodes (Referrers).

The Bruno Paradox: A student may be an academic liability but a marketing asset. The system visualizes this hidden value (Shadow LTV).

3. The Roadmap to Singularity

Phase 1 (Now): Infrastructure. Deploy Ledger, POS, and basic Student 360. Establish data sovereignty separate from the franchise.

Phase 2 (Year 4): The Dataset. Accumulate longitudinal behavioral data. Train the first generation of Shards.

Phase 3 (Year 8): The Oracle. The system begins to predict human outcomes and suggest interventions before failure occurs.

Phase 4 (Year 11): Legacy. The "Server in the Room" holds the source code for reproducible human success.

4. Operational Mandates

Data Sovereignty: No data leaves the local instance. Franchise reporting is done via sanitized, aggregated exports only.

Atomic Transactions: No financial movement occurs without a corresponding tax and commission log.

Human-First Interface: The UI must reduce cognitive load for teachers, "selling" them on prep time via their own psychological archetypes (Teacher HUD).
